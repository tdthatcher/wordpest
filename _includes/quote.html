"4) Late, late yestreen I saw the new Moon, With the old Moon in her arms; And I fear, I fear, My Master dear! We shall have a deadly storm. <div class='quote-author'> Coleridge</div>",
"5) I looked to heaven, and tried to pray; But or ever a prayer had gusht, A wicked whisper came, and made My heart as dry as dust. <div class='quote-author'> Coleridge</div>",
