<p>Wordpest is a demonstration site that I've put together to showcase a few of my skills.</p>

<h3>Content Writer</h3>
</div>
<p>As a content writer, my goal is to provide interesting, informative content that's designed to
catch eyes and draw readers to a website or print publication. Much of what I do is ghostwriting, and
I enjoy my work. </p>

<p>My topic areas of interest include law, medicine, science, technology, and tech-culture.</p>



<div class="techno techno-title">
<h3>Technologist</h3>
<p>I'm also a knowledgable computer user and experienced Linux system administrator. I build web servers for fun, sometimes, and have been known to self-host
material using a Linux (<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian"</a>, usually), Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack, either on my own hardware or on a virtual host. 
I occasionally program using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, and enjoy using single-board computers such as the 
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and the <a href="https://getchip.com/">CHIP</a>. 
I'm also active in the <a href="http://www.lugod.org">local Linux community</a>.
</p>

<p>This website is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site
generator. The layout is based on a version of a theme called <a href="https://github.com/hemangsk/safarnama">Safarnama</a> that I've modified 
to be more to my liking. Thanks, MIT licensing!

<h3>Scientist</h3>
</div>
<p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior with a minor in Insect Biology from 
The University of California at Davis (2014), during which time I assisted in a project studying the 
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154504">Quantitative Analysis of Reflected Light from Zebra Coats</a>.
I performed data analysis for this project using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a>.

that I can provide for you and your publication, project, or company. </p>
