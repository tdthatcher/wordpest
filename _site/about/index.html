<p>Wordpest is a demonstration site that I've put together to showcase a few of my skills.</p>
<p>Contact me at <b>tdt (at) wordpest dot com</b> for more information about me and the

<h3>Content Writer</h3>
</div>
<div class="writer-content">
<p>As a content writer, my goal is to provide interesting, informative content that's designed to
catch eyes and draw readers to a website or print publication. Much of what I do is ghostwriting, and
I enjoy my work!</p>

<p>My topic areas of interest include law, medicine, science, technology, and tech culture.</p>

<div class="techno-content">
<p>I'm a knowledgable computer user and experienced Linux system administrator. I build web servers for fun, sometimes, and have been known to self-host
material using a Linux (<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, usually), Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack, either on my own hardware or on a virtual host. 
I occasionally program using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, and enjoy using single-board computers such as the 
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and the <a href="https://getchip.com/">CHIP</a>. 
I'm also active in the <a href="http://www.lugod.org">local Linux community</a>.
</p>

<p>This website is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. 
The layout is based on a theme called <a href="https://github.com/hemangsk/safarnama">Safarnama</a> that I've modified into
something more my own using HTML, CSS, and the Liquid template language.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior with a minor in Insect Biology from 
The University of California at Davis (2014), during which time I assisted in a project studying the 
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154504">Quantitative Analysis of Reflected Light from Zebra Coats</a>.
I performed data analysis for this project using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a>.

"2) I do not love you as if you were salt-rose or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love you as certain things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul. <div class='quote-author'> Pablo Naruda</div>",
"3) Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread, For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise. <div class='quote-author'> Coleridge</div>",
"4) Late, late yestreen I saw the new Moon, With the old Moon in her arms; And I fear, I fear, My Master dear! We shall have a deadly storm. <div class='quote-author'> Coleridge</div>",
"5) I looked to heaven, and tried to pray; But or ever a prayer had gusht, A wicked whisper came, and made My heart as dry as dust. <div class='quote-author'> Coleridge</div>",
"6) NEVER seek to tell thy love, Love that never told can be; For the gentle wind doth move Silently, invisibly. <div class='quote-author'> Wm. Blake</div>",
"7) In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni. <div class='quote-author'> Traditional Riddle</div>",
"8) Specialization is for insects. <div class='quote-author'> Heinlein </div>",
"9) We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone... By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. <div class='quote-author'> Huxley</div>",
"10) Did I do anything wrong today, or has the world always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice? <div class='quote-author'> Arthur Dent</div>",
"11) Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. <div class='quote-author'>Douglas Adams</div>",
"12) Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy micturations are to me, as plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee. <div class='quote-author'> Traditional Vogon Poem </div>",
"13)I have learned silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind. <div class='quote-author'> Kahlil Gibran</div>",
"14)There is nothing new under the sun, but there are lots of old things we don't know yet. <div class='quote-author'> Ambrose Bierce</div>",
"15) The more you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn, the more places youâ€™ll go. <div class='quote-author'> Dr. Seuss</div>"];
