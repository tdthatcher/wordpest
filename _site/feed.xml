        <title>Tales of China</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That’s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sky is the limit only for those who aren’t afraid to fly!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, being a test pilot isn’t always the healthiest business in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I thought I must be dreaming.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I must be dreaming that
I thought I was awake,
For I was without question in
A most peculiar state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who was thinking I was dreaming
I was thinking in my sleep?
Was I awake while sleeping?
Oh, this was far too deep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or was I dreaming I was thinking
I was dreaming in the night?
And would I wake up tired or rested
Come the morning light?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarm beeped, and quickly I
Rolled off the rumpled bed,
Grateful for the clarity
That lit the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
